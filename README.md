Repository for my Student Gradebook Manager versions

## 📚 Overview
The Student Gradebook Manager is a Python-based application that allows users (teachers, tutors, students) to store and manage student performance data. It supports adding students, recording subject scores, calculating averages, and saving summaries.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was developed as part of the AS91896 and AS91897 internal standards for NCEA Level 2 Digital Technologies. The purpose is to demonstrate the use of complex programming techniques and effective project/version control processes.

## 👨‍💻 Key Features
- Add students with name and age
- Enter scores for multiple subjects
- Calculate and display average score per student
- Save individual student summaries to a file
- Search for summaries using student name
- Input validation for age, score, and menu options

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project taught me how to:
- Use nested dictionaries to manage complex data
- Apply input validation and error handling
- Save and retrieve data using files
- Use GitHub for version control and collaboration
